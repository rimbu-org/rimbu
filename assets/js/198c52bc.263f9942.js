And while I was doing that, I also found ways to have better typed methods for collections in Scala. I thought I might\nas well create a whole collection library instead of just one collection implementation. I learned a lot from this effort about immutable data structures and\ncreating strict but useful types. However, after some time, I realized that Scala, while having a great compiler, was holding me back in writing the code I wanted\nto write. Also, it seemed the community was getting split (due to a complete rewrite of Scala), and its popularity seemed to go down. In the meantime, Scala does have\na new Vector implementation with the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"insert")," and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"remove")," methods. I actually discovered this quite recently.

It turned out\nthat this was indeed the case. And stil, I could create quite rich interfaces for the collection methods.

And now, I have (finally) released the Rimbu library."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"There are many things still to be done, but I am satisfied with the library so far.
