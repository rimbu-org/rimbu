Each node has a unique value or identifier. Edges can be directed, in which case we will call it an Arrow Graph, or undirected, in which case we will call it an Edge Graph. Furthermore, edges and arrows can also have values, in which case we call it a Valued Graph.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"collections/list":{"id":"collections/list","title":"List","description":"The List is an immutable ordered sequence of elements that can be manipulated and accessed randomly in a relatively efficient way.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"collections/map":{"id":"collections/map","title":"Map","description":"A Map is a collection of entries, where each entry has a key and a value.

The source is unspecified, it may be a materialized object (e.g. an Array), or a calculated sequence (e.g. the fibonacci numbers). However, unlike an Iterable, a Stream offers many methods to change the values produced by the Stream, before it is consumed, without the need to materialize intermediate instances.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"collections/table":{"id":"collections/table","title":"Table","description":"A Table is an immutable 2-dimensional Map, containing row keys and column keys, where a combination of a row and column key can contain one value.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"deep/deep-match":{"id":"deep/deep-match","title":"Deep Match","description":"Overview","sidebar":"sidebar"},"deep/deep-patch":{"id":"deep/deep-patch","title":"Deep Patch","description":"Overview","sidebar":"sidebar"},"deep/deep-path":{"id":"deep/deep-path","title":"Deep Path","description":"Overview","sidebar":"sidebar"},"deep/deep-protected":{"id":"deep/deep-protected","title":"Protected","description":"TypeScript offers some helper types to prevent users from changing properties in objects.

Its main aim is to allow coders to create safe and performant programs without getting in the way. It is inspired by various other collection libraries, mainly Java\'s Guava library, the Java 8 Collection library, and Scala\'s collection library plus various ideas from the Scala community.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}')}}]);
