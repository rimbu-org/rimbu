Rimbu immutable collections will share memory as much as possible as long as no\nchanges need to be made. The collections only duplicates parts of shared data that are modified. The rest of the data remains shared. This is because the collections\nkeep their data in block-like structures, comparable to blocks on hard-drives. If some collection uses 50 blocks of data, and one value is changed, chances are that only 2 or 3 blocks need to be copied and changed, while the rest stays the same and shared. In some cases, persistent collections can be faster than mutable collections. For example, reversing a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"List")," of N elements in Rimbu has complexity O(logM(N)) where M is usually 32, so it is really fast for large collections as well.
