# Docs Pipeline — Stage 1 Status

**Stage 1 (extractor → per-package `.api.json`) is DONE.** Implementation lives
in `support/docs-extractor/`.

## What was built

- `src/extract.ts` uses **TypeScript 6** via an isolated `support/docs-extractor`
  package (own `node_modules`). Reason: the root installs native **TS7**, which
  dropped the programmatic compiler API; Bun's workspace hoisting broke a
  dual-setup alias, so the folder is isolated instead.
- Root `bun run docs` runs the extractor. Packages must be built first with the
  native TS7 `tsc` (the root `bun run build:seq` currently fails to build some
  packages under the resolved `tsc`; build each package individually with native
  tsc, or fix the workspace `tsc` resolution).

## Validated output (22 packages, `reactor` excluded)

- 1,472 entities, 0 invalid JSON files.
- 150 **companion** merges (interface + namespace + const → one entity).
- 508 `core` **redirects** (re-exports tagged `redirected` + `canonicalId`, no dup).
- 164 **advanced-tier** entities (separate from public).
- 1,452 entities with **GitHub source links**.
- Inheritance **inlined** (members tagged `inheritedFrom`, incl. cross-package
  like `VariantMapBase`); overloads **grouped** with `returnsNonEmpty` badge;
  JSDoc **structured**.

## Notes

- Base interfaces currently in `internal/` (e.g. `ListBase`) are still surfaced
  because inheritance recursion pulls them in. Strict tier purity (moving them to
  `advanced/`) is a separate future plan, out of scope here.
- Next: Stage 2 (aggregate + inheritance graph + hard-fail gates), then Stage 3
  (Starlight MDX + Markdown renderers).
