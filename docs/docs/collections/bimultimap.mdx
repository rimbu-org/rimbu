A BiMultiMap is a bidirectional MultiMap of keys and values, where each key-value association also has an inverse value-key association. There is a many-to-many mapping between keys and values.

## When to use

The BiMultiMap is useful when there is a many-to-many relation between to types of entities, and it is desired to query the relation in both directions.

For example, take a relation between persons and their hobbies. The BiMultiMap can efficiently tell you, given a person, what her hobbies are. But it can also efficiently tell you, given a hobby, which persons practice it.

:::info
Internally the BiMultiMap uses two immutable MultiMaps, making lookup operations in both directions fast. Insertion and memory usage are double that of a MultiMap.

## Exports

The `@rimbu/core` package exports the following _abstract_ BiMultiMap TypeScript types:

| Name                                                             | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`BiMultiMap<K, V>`](/api/rimbu/bimultimap/BiMultiMap/namespace) | a generic BiMultiMap between keys of type K and values of type V |
