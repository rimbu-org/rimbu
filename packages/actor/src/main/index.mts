/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@rimbu/actor` package offers experimental state management tools to model stateful logic
 * as actors backed by observable state that can be integrated into any framework.<br/>
 * Use it to create composable actors that expose immutable state snapshots and state‑changing
 * operations, while delegating persistence and reactivity to the underlying observables.<br/>
 * See the package README and the [Rimbu Docs](https://rimbu.org) for examples and current status.
