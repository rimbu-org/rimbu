 * The `@rimbu/collection-types/map-custom` entry exposes internal higher‑kind utilities

 * `@rimbu/collection-types/map` for advanced implementers.<br/>
 * Use it when you are building custom map families that should integrate with Rimbu’s
 * higher‑kind collection machinery; for normal map usage, consume the concrete map
 * implementations instead.
