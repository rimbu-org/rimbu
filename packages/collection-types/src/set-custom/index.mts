 * The `@rimbu/collection-types/set-custom` entry exposes internal higher‑kind utilities

 * `@rimbu/collection-types/set` for advanced implementers.<br/>
 * Use it when you are defining custom set families that should plug into Rimbu’s shared
 * collection‑type abstractions; for everyday development you will typically rely on
 * concrete set implementations instead.
