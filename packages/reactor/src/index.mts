/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@rimbu/reactor` package provides experimental React bindings for `@rimbu/actor`,
 * making it easy to connect actor‑based state and observable updates to React components.<br/>
 * Use it when you want to drive React state from Rimbu actors while keeping UI code focused
 * on rendering and side‑effects.<br/>
 * See the package README and the Rimbu docs for installation notes and examples.
