/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@rimbu/common` package provides shared equality and comparison helpers, range and index
 * utilities, lazy and async value helpers, traversal utilities, and rich type‑level helpers used
 * throughout the Rimbu ecosystem.<br/>
 * Use it when you need well‑tested primitives like `Eq`, `Comp`, `Range`, `OptLazy`, `AsyncOptLazy`,
 * or advanced type utilities in your own code, or when building on top of other Rimbu packages.<br/>
 * See the [Common docs](https://rimbu.org/docs/common/overview) and
 * [API reference](https://rimbu.org/api/rimbu/common) for more information.
