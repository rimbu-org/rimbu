 * The `@rimbu/actor/immer` entry provides helpers to integrate `@rimbu/actor` with
 * [`immer`](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) so you can express state updates as
 * convenient mutable drafts while still producing immutable state.<br/>
 * Use it when you want actor‑based state management with an Immer‑style update syntax.
