/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The `@rimbu/spy` package provides experimental, framework‑agnostic utilities for spying on,
 * stubbing and mocking functions, objects and classes in TypeScript without relying on
 * module‑level mocking.<br/>
 * Use it to create strongly‑typed spies that track calls, arguments and call sequences across
 * test frameworks (including Deno and ESM setups) while keeping your production APIs unchanged.<br/>
 * See the package README and the [Spy API docs](https://rimbu.org/api/rimbu/spy) for usage details.
